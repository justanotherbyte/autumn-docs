title: "Send Usage Event"
openapi: "POST /events"
---

This endpoint is for sending usage events to Autumn, required for tracking your metered features. Events can aggregated via:

- `COUNT`: Counts the number of times an event happened (eg. number of users created).
- `SUM`: Sums a value sent in the event properties (eg. total compute time)
  <Tip>
    {" "}
    If the `customer_id` you send doesn't already exist, Autumn will automatically
    create a new customer. You can optionally set the properties of this new customer
    through the `customer_data` field.
