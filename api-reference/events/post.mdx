This endpoint is for sending usage events to Autumn, required for tracking your usage-based features.

<Tip>

  If the `customer_id` you send doesn't already exist, Autumn will automatically
  create a new customer. You can optionally set the properties of this new customer
  through the `customer_data` field.
