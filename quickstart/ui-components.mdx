Autumn's UI components work with our Next.js library to handle your user billing flows out the box. It works for:

- Purchasing a product
- Paywalling features
- Upgrading or downgrading a subscription
- Cancelling a subscription
- Dealing with failed payments [coming soon]

Typically, when you make changes to your pricing model, you would need to update and test all these flows. Autumn takes care of it all.

<Info>
  Autumn's UI library makes use of [pricecn](https://pricecn.com) components, an
  open source library of shadcn/ui pricing components that we maintain.

## Product Change

The product change dialog will open when a customer wants to change their active product, such as when they upgrade or downgrade, to let them confirm how much they'll be charged and when.

#### Install

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/product-change-dialog.json
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/product-change-dialog.json
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/product-change-dialog.json
```

```bash bun
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/product-change-dialog.json
```

</CodeGroup>

This will download the product-change-dialog component in your `/components` directory, under a `/autumn` folder.

You can swap `clean` for `classic` or `dev` to use a different style that suits your brand. View them all at [pricecn.com](https://pricecn.com).

#### Usage

Pass in the `product-change-dialog` component to the `AutumnProvider` component. This allows Autumn to automatically open the product change dialog when they want to change their active product.

```jsx
import ProductChangeDialog from "@components/autumn/product-change-dialog";
import { useAutumn } from "autumn-js/next";

await attach({
  productId: "pro",
  dialog: ProductChangeDialog,
});
```

Now when you use the `attach()` function, Autumn will first call the `check({withPreview: true})` function to preview the purchase. The product change dialog will open if:

- The customer needs to input a quantity for their purchase (ie, if the product has prepaid prices)
- If the customer's card is already on file (ie, for upgrades, downgrades or add-ons).

If there are no inputs required and it's a new customer without a stored card, the customer will be redirected straight to the Stripe checkout page.

```jsx
import { useAutumn } from "autumn-js/next";

const SelectPlanButtons = () => {
  const { attach } = useAutumn();

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={async () => await attach({ productId: "free" })}>
        Get started for Free
      </button>
      <button onClick={async () => await attach({ productId: "pro" })}>
        Upgrade to Pro
      </button>
    </div>
  );
};
```

## Paywall

A paywall that prompts users to upgrade when they hit a usage limit, or don't have access to a feature.

#### Install

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/paywall-dialog.json
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/paywall-dialog.json
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/paywall-dialog.json
```

```bash bun
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/paywall-dialog.json
```

</CodeGroup>

This will download the pricing-dialog component in your `/components` directory, under a `/autumn` folder.

You can swap `clean` for `classic` or `dev` in the installation URL to use a different style that suits your brand. View them all at [pricecn.com](https://pricecn.com).

#### Usage

Pass in the `paywall-dialog` component to the `check` function (exported from the `useAutumn` hook).

```jsx
import PaywallDialog from "@components/autumn/paywall-dialog";
import { useAutumn } from "autumn-js/next";

const { check } = useAutumn();

const { data, error } = await check({
  featureId: "ai-messages",
  dialog: PaywallDialog,
});
```

Now when you use the `check()` function, if `allowed: false` is returned, the paywall will automatically open with the following details:

- The feature they don't have access to, or have run out of
- The next product tier they should upgrade to, in order to access the feature (or an add-on if no additional tier exists)
- A button that lets them purchase the next tier or add-on

<Info>
**Example**

In the snippet below, the button sends a message to an AI chatbot. In our `onclick` handler, we're using the `check()` function to see if the user has messages remaining. If they don't, the paywall will automatically open.

</Info>

## Pricing Table

The pricing table component displays your available products, the features available in each and any prices. It synchronizes with the products you define in Autumn.

#### Install

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/pricing-table.json
```

```bash pnpm
pnpm dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/pricing-table.json
```

```bash yarn
yarn dlx shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/pricing-table.json
```

```bash bun
bunx --bun shadcn@latest add https://ui.useautumn.com/classic/pricing-table.json
```

</CodeGroup>

This will download the product-change-dialog component in your `/components` directory, under a `/autumn` folder.

You can swap `clean` for `classic` or `dev` to use a different style that suits your brand. View them all at [pricecn.com](https://pricecn.com).

#### Usage

```javascript
import { PricingTable } from "@components/autumn/pricing-table";

export const PricingTableExample = () => (
  <div>
    <PricingTable />
  </div>
);
```
