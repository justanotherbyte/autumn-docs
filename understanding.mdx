The typical Autumn flow looks like this:

<Steps>
<Step title="Define your pricing model in the Autumn dashboard">
The dashboard is where you define which of your users get access to what, and how much they're charged for it. Here, you'll [create products](/products/create-product) and [manage your customers](/customers/managing-customers).
</Step>
<Step title="Call attach when a customer wants to purchase a product">
From your application, when your customer wants to [purchase](/products/enabling-product) one of your price plans, the `attach` endpoint will return a Stripe checkout URL.

Once they've purchased, Autumn grants access to the product's features that were defined in the dashboard.

If the customer is already paying for a plan, this will automatically handle any [upgrades and downgrades](products/enabling-product#upgrades-and-downgrades) too.

</Step>

<Step title="Check whether a customer has access to something">
From your application, you can [check](/features/check) in real-time whether a customer has access to:

- a product (eg, pro tier)
- a feature balance (eg, 10 remaining credits)
- a feature flag (eg, premium AI models)

Autumn will return whether they're `allowed` access, and you can use this to control access to your features. When you want to update your pricing model, you can do so without changing any of your code.

</Step>

<Step title="Track usage for usage-based features">
For your usage-based features, if Autumn tells you they're `allowed` access, you can [track their usage](/features/tracking-usage) to update their balance.

This means Autumn can enforce any usage limits you set (ie, by returning `allowed: false` once they hit a balance of 0). It also allows you to charge for usage (eg, $1 per AI tokens used), if you have a usage-based pricing model.

</Step>

<Step title="Display customer's information and balances">
When using usage-based features, you'll typically want to [display the customer's balance](/api-reference/customers/get) to them. You can do this from the `customers` route or hook, which will return customer information, the product they've purchased, and the balance of any usage-based features.

</Step>
