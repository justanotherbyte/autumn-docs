---

Feature entities are used to keep track of sub-balances for a feauture. For example, you may have a product that allows 500 credits **per user** per month.

To start, add the feature entity as a product item in the Autumn dashboard.

1. Go to the [Products Page](https://app.useautumn.com/products) and click into the product you want to add a feature entity to.
2. Click the "+ Feature" button.
3. Select the feature to track (eg, `credits`)
4. Click the elipsis on the right of the feature selector and click "Add per Feature Entity"
5. Select the entity you want to add (eg, per `user_id`)
6. Define any included usage (eg, 500 credits per user) and add the product item.

## Creating entities

You can manage feature entities via the `entities` route. This can be used to create, update and delete entities, such as when a seat or workspace is added or removed.

<Check>
  When you create an entity, a **usage event** will automatically be sent
  that increments the count of the number of entities (eg seats) being used.

This means if you create 2 entities for "seats", your usage of "seats" will be 2, allowing Autumn to bill accordingly if there's a price set.

        <CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/customers/org_123/entities" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"feature_id": "seats",
"id": "user_abc",
"name": "Brandon Yeo"
}'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const entity = await autumn.entities.create("org_123", {
  id: "user_abc",
  name: "Brandon Yeo",
  feature_id: "seats",
});
```

</CodeGroup>
```json
{
  "success": true
}
```

## Managing entity balances

Just like with normal features, you can check feature access and track usage events for each entity.

#### Check feature access

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL {7-8}
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/check" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"customer_id": "org_123",
"feature_id": "ai-messages",
"entity_id": "user_abc"
}'
```

```javascript Typescript {9-10}
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const { allowed } = await autumn.check({
  customer_id: "org_123",
  feature_id: "ai-messages",
  entity_id: "user_abc",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Send usage event

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL {7-8}
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/track" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"customer_id": "org_123",
"feature_id": "ai-messages",
"entity_id": "user_abc",
"value": 10
}'
```

```javascript Typescript {9-10}
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const event = await autumn.track({
  customer_id: "org_123",
  feature_id: "ai-messages",
  entity_id: "user_abc",
  value: 10,
});
```

</CodeGroup>

#### Customer-level vs entity-level balances

A customer-level balances is the total balance for the feature across all entities. Entity-level balances are the balance for a specific entity. You can check access and track usage events either at the customer-level or entity-level.

<Info>
**Example use case**

You have a product that allows 500 credits per user per month. However, the credits are shared across all users in the account.

You can create a feature entity for "seats" and then check access and send usage events at the top-level.

</Info>

To use top-level balances, just omit the `entity_id` from your check request.

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/check" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"customer_id": "org_123",
"feature_id": "ai-messages"
}'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const { allowed } = await autumn.check({
  customer_id: "org_123",
  feature_id: "ai-messages",
});
```

</CodeGroup>

And similarly for usage events.

<Note>
This will increment the usage counter for the top-level balance, and also deduct from the first-created entity so that the sum of the the entity balances is always the same as the top-level balance.
</Note>
<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X POST "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/track" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{
"customer_id": "org_123",
"feature_id": "ai-messages",
"value": 10
}'
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

const event = await autumn.track({
  customer_id: "org_123",
  feature_id: "ai-messages",
  value: 10,
});
```

</CodeGroup>

## Deleting Entities

<Check>
  Just as creating an entity sent a usage event for the associated feature,
  deleting an entity will decrease the usage.
</Check>

<CodeGroup>

```bash cURL
curl -X DELETE "https://api.useautumn.com/v1/customers/org_123/entities/user_abc" \
-H "Authorization: Bearer am_sk_1234567890" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
```

```javascript Typescript
import { Autumn as autumn } from "autumn-js";

await autumn.entities.delete("org_123", "user_abc");
```

</CodeGroup>
```json
{
  "success": true,
}
```
