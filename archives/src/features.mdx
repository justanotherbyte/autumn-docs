title: "Features"

In Autumn, there are 2 types of features you can create: `boolean` and `metered`. When defining a boolean or metered feature, the `id` you enter is what you'll use to check whether a customer has access later on.

### Configuring a metered feature

For metered features, you need to pass in:

1. One or more event names
2. An aggregation (either `COUNT` or `SUM`)

When calculating the usage of a metered feature, Autumn will first filter all events by `event_name`, and then either `COUNT` or `SUM` over them.

- `COUNT`: This aggregation simply takes the count of events
- `SUM`: This aggregation will sum based on a property you specify as shown below. This property should be passed in the `properties` field when sending an event.

#### Example of sending event with property

In the example below, if there is a metered event `minutes` which sums over the property `length`, then the following event will increment the metered feature by 2.

```js
await fetch("https://api.useautumn.com/v1/track", {
  method: "POST",
  headers: {
    Authorization: "Bearer <token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    customer_id: "cus_123",
    event_name: "minutes",
    properties: {
      length: 2,
    },
  }),
});
```
